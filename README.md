# Voron 2.4 (350mm)
(https://vorondesign.com/voron2.4)

This page should document my Voron2 build (350mm bed size) running on Klipper firmware (https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html). My first build of an 3D printer based on Chinese part kits (motion, fasteners etc.) and self-sourcing. The chamber is fully enclosed and prints ABS without warping in a decent quality and time. The printer is pretty much stock with some minor mods at the moment: 
- Waveshare 4.3 inch DSI LCD touchscreen instead of mini12864 LCD (running Klipperscreen: https://github.com/jordanruthe/KlipperScreen)
- Stealthburner beta (https://vorondesign.com/voron_stealthburner)
- ADXL345 resonance tester

Nevertheless, some changes to be made in near future: 
- Replacement of inductive probe, as this sensor has heat issues next to the hot-end. I think it is a design deficiency in the construction of the printer. Will replace with a Klick-Probe (https://github.com/jlas1/Klicky-Probe) for more durability and accuracy.
- Mod to single MGN12H rail an X-axis (see Voron Trident).

The build includes the following base setup:
- BTT Octopus V1.1 (https://github.com/bigtreetech/BIGTREETECH-OCTOPUS-V1.0)
- Clockwork2 extruder and Triangle Lab Dragon Hot-end V2 (high-flow)




- Klipper configuration 
- Slicer profiles
